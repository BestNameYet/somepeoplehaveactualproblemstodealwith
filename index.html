<div class="message you">Well here’s the deal…my lease is up on August 2. Obviously, I have no cash, no job, no family connections on which I can fall back, I’m at what they call rock bottom. You’re a person in the know, who? where? what can I do to extricate myself from this situation?</div>
<div class="message stacey">I think it’s time for you to reach out to your family. Be honest, do you need rehabilitation?</div>
<div class="message you">Most likely. Who in my family can I reach out to?</div>
<div class="message stacey">Your mom. I know she’s A Lot, but I guarantee she’d buy you a ticket and welcome you home. Hell, you can even blame all your problems on me if that makes her feel better</div>
<div class="message you">My mom? You think she’d do that? Don’t you remember my mom dislikes me from the Reagan pregnancy thing, to the Denise thing, she dislikes me so much that I try to remember what I did to her.</div>
<div class="message stacey">It wasn’t you she didn’t like. It was me. Trust.</div>
<div class="message you">How do I even frame that sort of request to a person I haven’t fucked with for years?</div>
<div class="message stacey">I bought a home near Tracey with my parents. I start a new job Monday. Reagan needs you to get better. I’ll take care of her, but you’ve gotta get help to take care of you</div>
<div class="message you">I guess I’m about to tuck tail and head back to California</div>
<div class="message you">I’m on foot out in channelview, this is the part where I burn through all my good will asking for loans</div>
<div class="message you">But forget about the loan part</div>
<div class="message stacey">Do you need help?</div>
<div class="message you">Sure do.</div>
<div class="message stacey">What do you need?</div>
<div class="message you">Whatever you can get me for…I have a few days on my lease, if you’re offering cash, I could use that if you know a way I can restart my life, I can use that…I’m at that rock bottom, the first one…the one before the real rock bottoms.,you know what I mean?</div>
<div class="message stacey">What kind of cash do you need? Or are you considering flying back home to California?</div>
<div class="message you">I’m going to reach out to my mom and hopefully she’s got me. I have a place to stay until August 2. I’m in a lease. I don’t won’t to have them evict me. But that should be enough to get through until I get a greyhound ticket. I’m walking home with nothing to drink and I have 39 cents. I need enough to buy a water really. I don’t know I don’t ask people for cash</div>
<div class="message you">I should’ve thought of that</div>
<div class="message stacey">Do you have somewhere I can send you money to? And do you need a plane ticket or something?</div>
<div class="message you">I’m going to first see if there’s a place waiting for me in California. But I’ll take a greyhound, it’s longer but cheaper.</div>
<div class="message stacey">Where can I send you money to get you food water. Bus ticket</div>
<div class="message you">My BofA is overdrawn you should be a to ApplePay.</div>
<div class="message stacey">I don’t have Apple Pay but do you have like Venmo or cashapp or something</div>
<div class="message you">I have PayPal</div>
<div class="message you">Let me see about cashapp?</div>
<div class="message stacey">I have PayPal send me your info</div>
<div class="message you">Samuel.john.nixon@gmail.com</div>
<div class="message you">Thank you Candace</div>
<div class="message stacey">I sent $200.</div>
<div class="message you">It showed up immediately</div>
<div class="message stacey">Let me know if you do decide to make your way back to California.</div>
<div class="message you">I’m going to have to have the come to Jesus talk with my mom and see where she’s at about letting me come back home for a moment. I wouldn’t even contact her but Stacey suggested it</div>
<div class="message stacey">I think maybe a reset, back home. Would do you good.</div>
<div class="message stacey">I’m sorry it’s come down to this. I truly hope you find the help you need.</div>
<div class="message you">It can’t hurt. 🧎🏾 well yeah, it would have to come to this wouldn’t it. I know right</div>
<div class="message you">July 26 25</div>
<div class="message you">That’s today’s date.</div>
<div class="message stacey">Yes. Yes it is. Don’t make it your last day. Please.</div>
